    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I came from a humble background and was brought up to be the best i can.</p>
    <p>Education- Studied the 8-4-4 system. Finished my primary studies in 2011 where I had studied in Marion Schools. Started my high school studies in 2012 until 2015 in Alliance School. Took my further learning in JKUAT where I defered in 2019 and joined Moringa School in April of this year until now.</P>
    <p>Job Experience- After high school I worked as a peer teacher in Githunguri High school.</p>
    <p>Why Programming- I have always had a certain interest in coding and decided that Moringa was the best place for me to learn and also improve my coding skills. And the tough environment will be my benefit </p>
